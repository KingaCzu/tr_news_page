                    A total of 107 people have now been killed by the coronavirus in Italy, which has the most serious
                    outbreak in Europe.

                    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the country's health service risked being overwhelmed.

                    Most of the more than 3,000 cases are in the north but others have been confirmed in 19 of Italy's
                    20 regions.

                Globally about 3,200 people have died and more than 90,000 have been infected, the vast majority in

                The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a pandemic - an epidemic spreading
                across the world through local transmission - but on Wednesday Germany's health minister said the
                coronavirus now met the definition.

                "The situation is changing very quickly... What's clear is that we have not yet reached the peak of the
                outbreak," Jens Spahn said.
